# Notifications-page
Notifications page using JS, HTML and CSS


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this notifications page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

users can:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
